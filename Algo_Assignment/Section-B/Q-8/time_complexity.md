# Time Complexity Analysis
### Approach
      The problem is solved using greedy approach. We need to minimize(optimize) total amount 
      to buy all license.
      
      
      
      
### Analysis      
    step 3 will take O(n^2 ) because selection sort is used.
    step 7 to 10 run n times hence O(n)
    Total Time Complexity = O(n^2  + O(n)
                          = O(n^2)
                        
   ## Hence , Time Complexity is O(n^2 ) which is polynomial in (n).
